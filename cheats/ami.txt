Make Amazon AMI from EC2 instance

1. Create, launch, and log into EC2 instance that you want to use as the basis
   for your AMI
2. Put your X.509 cert and private key into the /mnt directory
   [NOTE: X.509 private key, not key used for logging into your EC2 instance:
   generate one at Account/Security Credentials if need be. Also, the key goes
   into /mnt because this directory won't get included in the AMI.]
3. Change to a working directory of some kind and get the AMI tools:
     wget http://s3.amazonaws.com/ec2-downloads/ec2-ami-tools.zip
     unzip ec2-ami-tools.zip
     mv ec2-ami-tools-1.3-66634 ec2-ami
     mv ec2-ami ~
4. Configure .bashrc so the tools' bin path is in $PATH and AMI tool location
   is registered:
     export PATH=$PATH:/home/ec2-user/ec2-ami/bin
     export EC2_AMITOOL_HOME=/home/ec2-user/ec2-ami
5. In .bashrc, set env. variables for X.509 cert and private key locations:
     export EC2_PRIVATE_KEY=YOUR-PATH-TO-PRIVATE-KEY
     export EC2_CERT= YOUR-PATH-TO-X.509-CERTIFICATE
6. Become root, but load in environment variables from .bashrc:
     sudo su
     source /home/ec2-user/.bashrc
7. Bundle the EC2 instance (AWS account number is on security credential page)
   using the following command. Make sure whatever working directory specified
   by "-d" has lots of disk space (if necessary create an EBS volume for it):
     ec2-bundle-vol -d /mnt -k $EC2_PRIVATE_KEY -c $EC2_CERT \
       -u AWS_ACCOUNT_NUMBER -r i386
8. Upload bundle to S3 (you'll need Access Key ID and Secret Access Key from
   security credentials page)... bucket will be auto-created, but don't use
   punctuation in bucket name:
     ec2-upload-bundle -b YOUR-S3-BUCKET -m /mnt/image.manifest.xml \
     -a YOUR-AWS-ACCESS-ID -s YOUR-AWS-ACCESS-KEY
   NOTE: If you get an SSL-related error use --url http://s3.amazonaws.com
9. Register AMI (command will output ID of AMI, not important):
     ec2-register YOUR-S3-BUCKET/image.manifest.xml
