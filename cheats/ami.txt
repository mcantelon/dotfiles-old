Make Amazon AMI from EC2 instance

1. Create, launch, and log into EC2 instance that you want to use as the basis for your AMI
2. Put your X.509 cert and private key (X.509 private key, not key used for logging into your EC2 instance) into /mnt (so they don't get included in AMI)
3. Get AMI tools:
   wget http://s3.amazonaws.com/ec2-downloads/ec2-ami-tools.zip
   unzip ec2-ami-tools.zip
   mv ec2-ami-tools-1.3-66634 ec2-ami
4. Configure .bashrc so the tools' bin path is in $PATH and AMI tool location is registered:
   export PATH=$PATH:/home/ec2-user/ec2-ami/bin
   export EC2_AMITOOL_HOME=/home/ec2-user/ec2-ami
5. Set environment variables for X.509 cert and private key file locations
   export EC2_PRIVATE_KEY=YOUR-PATH-TO-PRIVATE-KEY
   export EC2_CERT= YOUR-PATH-TO-X.509-CERTIFICATE
6. Become root, but load in environment variables from .bashrc
   sudo su
   source .bashrc
7. Bundle the EC2 instance (AWS account number is on security credential page)
   ec2-bundle-vol -d /mnt -k $EC2_PRIVATE_KEY -c $EC2_CERT -u AWS_ACCOUNT_NUMBER -r i386
8. Upload bundle to S3 (you'll need Access Key ID and Secret Access Key from security credentials page)... bucket will be auto-created, but don't use punctuation in bucket name:
ec2-upload-bundle -b YOUR-S3-BUCKET -m /mnt/image.manifest.xml -a YOUR-AWS-ACCESS-ID -s YOUR-AWS-ACCESS-KEY
9. Register AMI (command will output ID of AMI, not important):
   ec2-register YOUR-S3-BUCKET/image.manifest.xml
